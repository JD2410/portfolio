# Jonathan Delves - Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my professional experience, projects, and skills. It is built with a modern front-end stack, utilising **React** as the framework and **Tailwind** CSS for styling and structure.
The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

## Tech Stack ##

* ⚛️ React – Component-based UI development
* 🎨 Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling
* 📄 JSX – Declarative UI structure
* 🌐 JavaScript (ES6+) – Core scripting
* 🖌️ CSS – Custom styling where needed
