            description: "For this project, I designed and developed a WordPress website for a father-and-son painting and decorating business. Starting with agreed wireframes, I created a clean, bright design that captured their brand identity. WordPress provided the flexibility for them to update their own content, including galleries and contact details, without relying on ongoing support. To keep the build efficient and easy to maintain, I used SCSS for styling and chose InfinityFree as a cost-effective hosting solution. The contact form was set up with Contact Form 7 and integrated with Brevo to ensure reliable email delivery.",

            description: "For Christopher William Building Solutions, I designed a website and full brand identity from the ground up. With no existing assets, I created a traditional look using clean fonts and a red-and-black colour scheme, paired with architectural motifs to reflect their bespoke work. I also designed the logo, inspired by architectural plans, to strengthen the professional tone. The site was built as a flat-file website, hosted on Netlify for simplicity, with an external service handling the contact form and reCAPTCHA security. Special attention was given to metadata to ensure the site displayed cleanly when saved to a mobile home screen.",

Previously, staff had to re-enter data manually, a time-consuming and error-prone process. The web-based system, hosted locally on their machine, allowed them to upload CSV files, review a summary of the data, and generate formatted labels ready for printing on standard Avery sheets. By removing the need for internet access or third-party tools, this project streamlined a repetitive task, improved accuracy, and delivered a simple, efficient offline solution.",

I began by creating screen designs with the HR team and later acted as the bridge between developers and stakeholders. The first version, built in C#, saw me working on front-end design and UI improvements. A second, modernised version used Angular and a microservices architecture, where I led UI/UX design. I later moved into product ownership, writing technical specifications and working with the CTO to introduce AI features that streamlined performance reviews. Though no longer active, the project was a key learning experience.",
